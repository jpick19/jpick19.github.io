    <p>I've been interested in computer hardware and software for a long time, and
        back in high school was when I was first introduced to programming. My teacher first taught us Visual Basic as an introduction to programming
    and gave us assignments such as making a calculator or simple game of tic-tac-toe.</p>
    
    <p>Then I moved on to C# and helped create some games with a group of friends.
        As a final project for the class we developed 2d side scrolling platform game. 
    I helped program the movement within the game and designed the levels. It was called "Switch" because instead of only just being able to jump around the character was able to 'switch' from walking on the ground to walking on the ceiling.</p>
    
    <p>After high school I got a job at a PC repair shop and earned valuable experience 
    with helping customers with the problems they had with their computers.
    I would usually help with hardware issues and build computers from scratch or just replace parts. 
    Sometimes I would help clean viruses and install anti-virus programs, but I would usually work with hardware most.</p>

    <p>I graduated with an AA degree from Florida Southwestern in June of 2018, and transferred to Florida Gulf Coast University. After transferring was when I first began taking classes involving programming in college. All my other experience came from high school or just experimenting as a hobby and creating some games with friends. The classes I have or am taking at FGCU include Computer Software and Technology, Intro to Computer Science, and Information Systems.</p>
